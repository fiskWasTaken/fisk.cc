<strong>[WARNING!] Peanuthero_'s SHADY BUSINESS TACTICS! $4000+ HELD/STOLEN!</strong> - <a href="https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=1915596">minimalist</a> -  <strong>07-06-2016</strong>
<br>
<br>
Hello, I am here to expose <a href="https://hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=2767097" target="_blank" rel="ugc" class="mycode_url"><span style="color: #00AAFF;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Peanuthero_</span></span></a> for attempting/undergoing multiple scams. He has a history of using the same addresses that he used to scam when dealing with me, he has a history of suspending users' servers (from his hosting service, OutlawServers), and just lying in general. To my knowledge, over $4000 has been held by Peanuthero_.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I will list my encounters with Peanuthero_ to simplify things. Chronological order:<br>
<ol type="1" class="mycode_list"><li>Peanuthero_ asks for me to exchange his BTC to Interac e-Transfer, 1:1. I gladly take this offer and profit from my exchanges.<br>
</li>
<li>Later, users message me asking if I've dealt with this user. Clicking on their threads list, I see one scam for <span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="mycode_u">$700</span>. This is not a small amount of money. Doing detective work, I managed to find the address to which the money was sent.<br>
<a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1P9JgLr7wefAmxpRhAh1toq6Yz9Ehsi9Bo" target="_blank" rel="ugc" class="mycode_url">https://blockchain.info/address/1P9JgLr7wefAmxpRhAh1toq6Yz9Ehsi9Bo</a><br>
<a href="https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5295317" target="_blank" rel="ugc" class="mycode_url">https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5295317</a><br>
</li>
<li>Peanuthero_ is still unaware that I am highly involved and communicating with the user who, at that point, was out $700. He asks if I want to buy more BTC, and I agree. He sends me two more payments:<br>
<a href="https://blockchain.info/tx/a7443de37f360fe47508e833e83df23e3c0b9daf8e3a1c1f601b4ac5c73638cf" target="_blank" rel="ugc" class="mycode_url">One from his main address</a>, <a href="https://blockchain.info/tx/8ce2ec718d47b92c935816e57406f06d42b532723687ac270f16fdbac0a7dc6a" target="_blank" rel="ugc" class="mycode_url">and another from a new address.</a><br>
</li>
<li>WAIT! The new address...that's the same one to which the $700 was sent!<br>
<a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1P9JgLr7wefAmxpRhAh1toq6Yz9Ehsi9Bo" target="_blank" rel="ugc" class="mycode_url">https://blockchain.info/address/1P9JgLr7wefAmxpRhAh1toq6Yz9Ehsi9Bo</a><br>
</li>
<li>I question Peanuthero_, holding his money in limbo until gochi receives what he paid for. Eventually, Peanuthero_ broke and he gave gochi what he paid for: the servers. I send Peanuthero_ his money.<br>
</li>
<li>WEEKS LATER, a new deal dispute is created. For $3300. $3300! <br>
<a href="https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5327246" target="_blank" rel="ugc" class="mycode_url">https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5327246</a><br>
</li>
<li>Unfortunately, due to past encounters (as aforementioned), I was/am not as involved in this deal dispute as I probably should be. However, Peanuthero_ suspended fire_bender's server without any proof (and rightfully so - he's allegedly hosting child porn...but who buys $3300 worth of servers to host child porn on [what I assume to be] the clearnet?)<br>
</li>
</ol>
<br>
Of course, no community alert is complete without a conclusion of the presented points. Read over points #2-4 and you'll see where he went wrong. Peanuthero_ sent me $12 from the same address that he used to scam. <br>
<br>
I would not deal with him, whatsoever. <a href="https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5225162" target="_blank" rel="ugc" class="mycode_url">Outlawservers</a> undergoes the shadiest business I've ever witnessed and <a href="https://www.acuata.com/" target="_blank" rel="ugc" class="mycode_url">their network of other servers &amp; a stresser </a> is probably equally as shady.<br>
<br>
Deal with caution, love from Minimalist.

Update...Peanuthero_ sent me some screenshots of the things that fire_bender was hosting. With some investigative work, I've discovered that Peanuthero_ is bullshitting me. I can't show anything for obvious reasons.<br>

The man had no problem with what he was hosting but when a multitude of people complain about downtime he throws crazy allegations.

I'm not sure, but fire_bender has not profited from his CP business (if he has one).<br>

I host CP on clearnet all time, but I see no reason for his server to be suspended. Just google CP and you find it at CP.com<br>

The datacenter directly contacted me and gave me a copy of the server and the tor link.
