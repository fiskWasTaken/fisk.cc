# Who is Alexandre Gagnon?

I've had many run-ins with Alexandre Gagnon, aka Peanuthero / Alex. People do not seem to be aware that he is a career criminal.

Despite a series of coincidences, Alex will vehemently deny he is Peanuthero. Unfortunately, Alex's modus operandi of feigned legal threats and DDoS attacks work against him, and there are many ties between the two personas.

## Acuata.com

Acuata.com is linked from various projects belonging to Alex. Acuata.com has listed "Alexandre Gagnon" as the Director [since at least 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180412212144/https://acuata.com/). Without any reasonable doubt, we can deduce this is Alex.

Today, Acuata.com links to SteamCollector and a few other services related to mannco.store. In the past, this portfolio referenced websites such as:

* layer7.pw, a DDoS booter service.
* OutlawServers.ca, a hosting service falsely claiming to provide offshore hosting.
* BPServers.ru, a hosting service which just resold from another provider at 200% markup.

## False DMCA takedowns against Dofus private servers

Dofus is a MMORPG popular among French-speaking communities. Like many online games, Dofus has private servers operated by individuals.

[There is a thread](https://archive.ph/ElqbV) (in French) documenting Alex's attempts to send fraudulent DMCA takedown notices by impersonating the game's developer.

Peanuthero would send false DMCAs to Cloudflare as "Alexandre Gagnon".

## HackForums scams: OutlawServers, BPServers, layer7.pw et al 

In 2016, Alex took to scamming users of HackForums, with claims of "offshore, takedown-free" hosting, which was actually hosted in the Netherlands, and other dubious projects.

Alex's services were eventually blacklisted by Spamhaus, a widely-used anti-spam blacklist. Covering this up, Alex infamously scammed a user out of $4,000 and claimed it was because the user was hosting CP.

Unfortunately, these threads require a sign-in and cannot be archived. "peanuthero hackforums" on Google reveals more.

Alex would sign up to HackForums with sock accounts to defend his own services, and eventually got banned from the forum in July 2016 after having scammed an uncountable number of users.

## SteamRep tagging, ban evasion and attacks on the ScrapTF network

Peanuthero received a SteamRep tag after it was revealed one his bots, for some reason, had an unexplained SteamRep Scammer tag. [Peanuthero appealed against the tag](https://forums.steamrep.com/threads/appeal-76561198026734540-%E2%9C%85peanuthero-mannco-trade-banned-by-sr.180729/), but this was subsequently declined.

Soon, Peanuthero "stepped down" from mannco.*, and Alex took his place. Nobody knew who Alex was, and it was rumoured, but never proven, that him and Peanuthero was the same person.

Alex took to attacking ScrapTF related sites in late 2020. 

One night, Alex was scouring pages of backpack.tf to launch DDoS attacks on from his home IP address. Alex was logged out of the site, but cross-referencing our server logs and IP logs for his own user account directed us to him. This led us to investigate and connect their identities. 

The mannco.store staff were promptly banned from backpack.tf, and we requested SteamRep to apply Alex's SteamRep tag to his new account. This prompted the mannco.store staff to make [this post](https://archive.ph/hkDUL), where they, again, make the claim that they are two separate people.

----

Alex lies as a defense mechanism. Alex will never admit his past identity, and would rather you believe that they are separate people: that Peanuthero just vanished off of the internet, and it was just a freaky coincidence that they had the same name, place of work, place of living. 

Of course, this is ridiculous.
