In December 2020, there was a [distributed denial-of-service attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) on the ScrapTF network; the collective of *Team Fortress 2* trading websites better known as backpack.tf, Scrap.TF, and Marketplace.TF. The attacker would navigate to specific pages moments before an attack would hit. Cross-referencing these requests with known user IPs allowed us to determine who was doing it.

This prompted further investigation, shedding new light on a criminal with a history of online scams.

----

**Alexandre Gagnon**, or *Peanuthero*, is an individual from Quebec, Canada. Alex has a paper trail of scams on the internet due to his activities on HackForums and other websites. If you are familiar with *Team Fortress 2* trading, this is the same Alex that runs Mannco.store.

Alex's modus operandi is DDoS attacks and false DMCA takedowns against competing services. Despite efforts to separate his identities, there are many ties between his personas. Alex will deny any claims. This post documents these behaviours and links his different identities together.

## Alex's many, many HackForums scams
**NB**: The linked threads are local archives because HackForums requires a user login. You can verify the contents yourself by signing in to HackForums, as the threads are likely to stay.

Alex scammed uncountable amounts of money from HackForums users.

In 2016, Alex took to HackForums to sell web hosting services. Posting as *Peanuthero*, Alex would claim his services were "offshore" and "takedown-free". In other words, his services would ignore takedown requests for unlawful content.

Users would buy Alex's services under the impression that his claims were legitimate. Alex was actually [reselling hosting from the Netherlands](/archive/bpservers-scam-alert.html) at 200% markup.

[Spamhaus](https://www.spamhaus.org/), a widely-used anti-spam blacklist, soon blacklisted Alex's services. Covering this up, [Alex scammed a user out of over US$4,000](/archive/scammed-by-peanuthero.html), claiming it was because the user was hosting child pornography. The user in question discovered that [Alex was fabricating support tickets from the upstream](/archive/peanuthero-support-tickets.html) to prove his claim.

HackForums would ban Peanuthero from the website in July 2016. Alex would return and [sign up to HackForums with sock accounts](/archive/bpservers-ru-sock.html) to continue advertising his own services. Seasoned users identified him almost immediately, and HackForums would ban his sock accounts. Alex would then sever access for the users who paid for his service.

Alex would return a second time to advertise yet another offshore service. This turned out to be another snake oil host claiming to operate out of the Seychelles, again [traced to the Netherlands](/archive/shadowhosting.html).

Evading more bans, an investigation of Alex's cryptocurrency wallet transfers showed he was [still using wallet addresses from previous scams](/archive/peanuthero-ban-evasion.html).

After finally leaving the forum, Alex would continue hosting payment portals for BPServers.ru [through to 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20170710174638/https://bpservers.ru/), although the abandoned client area was no longer usable.

## Acuata.com
Alex's HackForums scams would link to Acuata.com in the footer. Likewise, Acuata.com would [link back](https://web.archive.org/web/20150423042823/http://acuata.com/) to these services. Acuata is "a private contractor that work on multiples (sic) communities & websites".

![](/img/articles/acuata.com-now.png)

Although the site is way older, Acuata has listed "Alexandre Gagnon" as the Director/Founder [since at least 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180412212144/https://acuata.com/). This overlaps the time in which Alex changed his identities.

Also on the roster is:

* Emmanuel Chevreux, a long-time friend of Alex from his Dofus days, who has worked alongside him since [at least 2015](https://archive.ph/jTL33) on a project known as Sourcerev.
* Anthony Garcia, a.k.a. "Lagg", a Team Fortress 2 Wiki sysop.

Acuata.com first appeared on January 15, 2014, having a very different set of services on its roster:

* layer7.pw, a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) / "booter" service.
* OutlawServers.ca, a "bullet proof" hosting service. "Bullet proof" is another phrase meaning they will ignore any legal letters.
* BPServers.ru, an offshore hosting service "for your personal botnet".

![](/img/articles/acuata.com-2016.png)

These services no longer exist, and the frontpage of Acuata.com no longer reference these. Snapshots are still available on [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20220000000000*/acuata.com).

[Despite being on the portfolio in 2020](https://archive.ph/KHmlf), Mannco.store and Mannco.trade are not shown on the Acuata.com frontpage as of writing. Yet, many site-related staff are still listed here.

Acuata.com has never changed ownership according to WHOIS records. Thus, Alex has always been in control of this website.

## Dofus, and false DMCA takedowns

Dofus is an MMORPG popular among French-speaking communities. Dofus has private servers operated by individuals. Alex, or *Peanuthero*, operated *AsterionServeurs* from roughly 2008 to 2012.

Alex was hostile towards other server operators, filing false DMCA notices against at least one. [A thread (in French)](https://archive.ph/ElqbV) documents Alex sending fraudulent DMCA takedown notices by impersonating the game's developer.

As *Peanuthero*, Alex would send false DMCAs to Cloudflare as *Alexandre Gagnon*.

Alex identified himself as the owner of AsterionServeurs and Acuata.com on his [former personal website](https://web.archive.org/web/20141218054701/http://peanuthero.com/).

## Mannco.store, and an identity crisis

Peanuthero's first appearance in the Steam trading space was with *mannco.jackpot*. This was a gambling website which would use backpack.tf web APIs to fetch price data. At that time, a policy was in place to disallow use of this data by gambling websites. After revoked API access and repeated attempts to circumvent a block, Alex took to launching DDoS attacks on backpack.tf.

Peanuthero would receive a SteamRep tag when it was discovered one of his bots, for some reason, had an unexplained SteamRep Scammer tag. [Peanuthero's appeal against the tag](https://forums.steamrep.com/threads/appeal-76561198026734540-%E2%9C%85peanuthero-mannco-trade-banned-by-sr.180729/) was declined.

Mannco.trade and Mannco.store launched around this time. This is when *Peanuthero* stepped down, and "Alex" took his place. Nobody knew who Alex was, and Alex had no history in the trading scene. While it was suspect that they were the same person, no concrete proof was ever surfaced, allowing him to operate this way for roughly a year.

Certain Mannco.store staff have helped Alex with his scams. The footer of HackForums-era BPServers.ru references web designer brand *wbxdsg*, a project of [Nicolas Durand](https://archive.ph/B1CbV). This name appears in the footer of an old Mannco.trade page template which is [still online today](https://archive.ph/mXnG8).

In 2020, [Alex registered MANNCO ONLINE LIMITED](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/12440217/filing-history) in the United Kingdom's Companies register. This was dissolved after a year. For some reason, Alex put his nationality as 'British' in the original filing before changing it to Canadian.

## Attacks on the ScrapTF network

Following a major feature release on Mannco.store, all three sites in the ScrapTF network were being hit with DDoS attacks. Whenever an attack would happen, Alex would not-so-subtly make comments about downtime over Discord.

Cross-examining IPs of who was browsing particular pages right before attacks were directed at them led us directly to Alex. Conclusively, we knew it was him doing this. This led to the discovery of the information posted in the previous sections.

With the identities linked, the main Mannco.store staff received bans from the website, and SteamRep reinstated a tag on Alex's new Steam account upon our request. Following this incident, Mannco.store published [an article](https://archive.ph/hkDUL) still trying to claim that Alex and Peanuthero are two different people.

Alex has continued to launch DDoS attacks on the ScrapTF network since. Alex has occasionally reached out to me to claim he is still not Alex and threaten litigation in broken English.

This is pretty much where this story ends -- I find his personality fascinating, but more importantly, his identity and behaviour should remain permanently on record.
