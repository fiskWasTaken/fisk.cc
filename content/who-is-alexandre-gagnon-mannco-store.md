I've had many run-ins with Alexandre Gagnon, aka Peanuthero / Alex. Alex is a career criminal from Quebec who has scammed many, and rather than atone for what he has done, has ran to new pastures. 

Despite a series of coincidences, Alex will vehemently deny being associated with his previous aliases. Unfortunately, Alex's modus operandi of feigned legal threats and DDoS attacks work against him, and there are many ties between the two personas.

## Acuata.com

Acuata.com is linked from various projects belonging to Alex. Acuata is "a private contractor that work on multiples (sic) communities & websites".

Acuata has listed "Alexandre Gagnon" as the Director/Founder [since at least 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180412212144/https://acuata.com/). Without any reasonable doubt, we can deduce this is Alex. Also on the roster is Emmanuel Chevreux, a long-time friend of Alex from his Dofus days, who has worked alongside him since long before his identity change.

However, Acuata.com dates back to 2014, and has previously had other services on its roster:

* layer7.pw, a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) / "booter" service.
* OutlawServers.ca, a "bullet proof" hosting service.
* BPServers.ru, an offshore hosting service "for your personal botnet".

## Dofus, and false DMCA takedowns

Dofus is a MMORPG popular among French-speaking communities. Like many online games, Dofus has private servers operated by individuals.  Alex operated his own community from roughly 2008 to 2012.

Alex had a hostile attitude towards other server operators, and filed false DMCA takedowns for at least one. [A thread (in French)](https://archive.ph/ElqbV) documents Alex's attempts to send fraudulent DMCA takedown notices by impersonating the game's developer.

Peanuthero would send false DMCAs to Cloudflare as "Alexandre Gagnon".

## HackForums scams: OutlawServers, BPServers, layer7.pw et al 

![](/img/articles/skype.png)

In 2016, Alex took to HackForums to sell web hosting services. Alex would claim his services were "offshore" and "takedown-free". These services would directly link to Acuata.com in the footer, and likewise, Acuata.com was linking back to these services.

Users would purchase these services under the impression that they were legitimate. However, users discovered that his services were not actually "takedown-free", and was merely reselling hosting from the Netherlands at 200% markup.

Alex's services were also eventually blacklisted by [Spamhaus](https://www.spamhaus.org/), a widely-used anti-spam blacklist. Covering this up, Alex infamously scammed a user out of $4,000, falsely claiming it was because the user was hosting CP.

Unfortunately, these threads require a sign-in and cannot be archived.

Alex would sign up to HackForums with sock accounts to defend his own services, and eventually got banned from the forum in July 2016 after having scammed an unknown number of users.

## SteamRep tagging, ban evasion and attacks on the ScrapTF network

Alex was DDoSing backpack.tf as early as 2017, for some reason. He would brag about skirting around API restrictions for his gambling site.

Peanuthero received a SteamRep tag after it was revealed one his bots, for some reason, had an unexplained SteamRep Scammer tag. [Peanuthero appealed against the tag](https://forums.steamrep.com/threads/appeal-76561198026734540-%E2%9C%85peanuthero-mannco-trade-banned-by-sr.180729/), but this was subsequently declined.

Soon, Peanuthero "stepped down" from mannco.*, and Alex took his place. Nobody knew who Alex was, and it was rumoured, but never proven, that him and Peanuthero was the same person.

Again, Alex took to attacking ScrapTF related sites with DDoS tools some time in late 2020. 

One night, Alex was scouring pages of backpack.tf to launch DDoS attacks on from his home IP address. Alex was logged out of the site, but backpack.tf permanently stores IP records per user account. We were able to cross-reference an IP address that was navigating to pages before a booter would run on that route, and an IP address recently used by Alex. This led us to investigate and connect their identities.

The mannco.store staff were promptly banned from backpack.tf, and we requested SteamRep to apply Alex's SteamRep tag to his new account. This prompted the mannco.store staff to make [this post](https://archive.ph/hkDUL), where they, again, make the claim that they are two separate people.

Fast forward to 2022, Alex has decided to DDoS our network *once again*, so I decided to take the time to write this up and explain why he is banned from everywhere and why you should not want to have anything to do with him.

Alex may claim to have "come clean", but still refuses to accept that he has this history.

We have: a Peanuthero and an Alex who both declare themselves to be Alexandre Gagnon, both from Quebec, both working on the same projects, with the same friends. Emmanuel Chevreux has worked on Sourcerev since 2015 [according to his resume](https://archive.ph/jTL33), so it is likely that Emmanuel had something to do with Alex's Hackforums scam projects as well. 

Alex lies as a defense mechanism. Alex will never admit his past identity, and would rather you believe that they are separate people: that Peanuthero just vanished off of the internet, and it was all just a freaky coincidence.

Of course, this is ridiculous.
