If you are reading this, you may have had a run-in with Alexandre Gagnon, aka Peanuthero / "Robert Deschemin" / Alex. Alex is a career criminal from Quebec with a history of fraudulent activity, and has gone to great lengths to reinvent his online persona to cover this up.

Despite a series of coincidences, Alex will vehemently deny being associated with his previous alias ("Peanuthero"). Unfortunately, Alex's modus operandi of feigned legal threats and DDoS attacks work against him, and there are several ties between the two personas.

## Acuata.com

Acuata.com is linked from various projects belonging to Alex. Acuata is "a private contractor that work on multiples (sic) communities & websites".

Acuata has clearly listed "Alexandre Gagnon" as the Director/Founder [since at least 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180412212144/https://acuata.com/). We can reasonably assume this is Alex. Also on the roster is Emmanuel Chevreux, a long-time friend of Alex from his Dofus days, who has worked alongside him since at least 2015.

Acuata.com was registered on January 15, 2014, previously having a very different set of services on its roster:

* layer7.pw, a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) / "booter" service.
* OutlawServers.ca, a bullet proof* hosting service.
* BPServers.ru, an offshore hosting service "for your personal botnet".

*bullet proof hosting (BPH) refers to hosting that ignores any complaints about illicit activities, so these services are often used by those who want to host illegal materials.

These services no longer exist, and the frontpage of Acuata.com no longer references these. But snapshots are still available on web.archive.org.

For some reason, Mannco.store and Mannco.trade are not shown on the current iteration as of writing, [despite being on the portfolio in 2020](https://archive.ph/KHmlf). I do not know why. I speculate it is to add a degree of separation between Alex's past identity and his new projects.

According to WHOIS records, Acuata.com has never changed ownership. Thus, all the projects on the Acuata portfolio are claimed by him to be his own.

## Dofus, and false DMCA takedowns

Dofus is an MMORPG popular among French-speaking communities. Like many online games, Dofus has private servers operated by individuals.  Alex operated his own community, AsterionServeurs, from roughly 2008 to 2012. Alex was using Peanuthero as a username at this time.

Alex had a hostile attitude towards other server operators, and filed false DMCA takedowns for at least one. [A thread (in French)](https://archive.ph/ElqbV) documents Alex's attempts to send fraudulent DMCA takedown notices by impersonating the game's developer.

As Peanuthero, Alex would send false DMCAs to Cloudflare as "Alexandre Gagnon". 

We know this is the same Peanuthero that eventually goes on to scam HackForums users, as he identified himself as owners of such services on his [former website](https://web.archive.org/web/20141218054701/http://peanuthero.com/).

In 2016, Alex took to HackForums to sell web hosting services. Posting as Peanuthero, Alex would claim his services were "offshore" and "takedown-free". These services would directly link to Acuata.com in the footer, and likewise, Acuata.com was [linking back](https://web.archive.org/web/20150423042823/http://acuata.com/) to these services.

Alex would use "Robert Deschemin" as an alias when providing customer support. This is a fake name that does not appear in any whitepage listings and has only ever been used to register domains, which does not require verification.

Users would purchase Alex's services under the impression that his claims were legitimate. However, users discovered that his services were not actually "takedown-free", and [was merely reselling hosting from the Netherlands](/archive/Community%20Alert%20BPServers,%20a%20_Bullet%20Proof%20Host_,%20Just%20Reselling%20from%20Ecatel%20-%20Also%20Ran%20by%20Peanuthero%20-%20Printable%20Version.html) at 200% markup.

Alex's services were also eventually blacklisted by [Spamhaus](https://www.spamhaus.org/), a widely-used anti-spam blacklist. Covering this up, [Alex infamously scammed a user out of over US$4,000](/archive/Scammed%20by%20Peanuthero_%20UID=2767097%20for%20$3,377.78%20-%20Printable Version.html), falsely claiming it was because the user was hosting CP. The user in question discovered that [Alex was fabricating support tickets from the upstream](/archive/Scammed%20by%20Peanuthero_%20UID=2767097%20for%20$3,377.78%20-%20Printable Version.html) to prove his claim. 

Another reputable user investigated Alex's cryptocurrency wallet transfers and identified that he was [still using wallet addresses known to used in scams](/archive/Community%20Alert%20[WARNING!]%20Peanuthero_'s%20SHADY%20BUSINESS%20TACTICS!%20$4000+%20HELD_STOLEN!%20-%20Printable%20Version.html).

Alex's Peanuthero account eventually got banned from the forum in July 2016. Alex would return and [sign up to HackForums with sock accounts](/archive/BPServers.ru%20_%20BulletProof%20DEDI_WEB%20_%20INSTANT%20DELIVERY%20_%20HOST%20ANYTHING%20YOU%20WANT%20!%20-%20Printable%20Version.html) to continue advertising his own services. Seasoned users identified him almost immediately.

Alex returned a second time as 'manandco' (mannco?) to advertise another offshore service, ShadowHosting. Just like prior projects, this was another snake oil hosting service claiming to operate out of the Seychelles, but [traced to the Netherlands](/archive/Community%20Alert%20Shadowhosting.net%20-%20Fake%20Bullet%20Proof%20Hosting%20-%20Ban%20Evasion%20-%20Proxy%20Selling%20-%20Printable Version.html).

After being banned, Alex would continue hosting payment portals for BPServers.ru [through to 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20170710174638/https://bpservers.ru/), even though the client area was abandoned and could no longer be used.

Also in the footer of BPServers is the text "design by wb x dsg". This refers to the services of [Nicolas Durand](https://archive.ph/B1CbV). **This name appears in the footer of an older page template of Mannco.trade** which is [still online today](https://archive.ph/mXnG8).

## SteamRep tagging, ban evasion and attacks on the ScrapTF network

Peanuthero initially appeared in the Steam trading space by hosting a gambling site, mannco.jackpot. Alex took to DDoSing backpack.tf as early as 2017, for some reason (presumably because we took steps to remove his access from our APIs, but that's just speculation).

Peanuthero received a SteamRep tag after it was revealed one his bots, for some reason, had an unexplained SteamRep Scammer tag. [Peanuthero appealed against the tag](https://forums.steamrep.com/threads/appeal-76561198026734540-%E2%9C%85peanuthero-mannco-trade-banned-by-sr.180729/), but this was subsequently declined.

Mannco.trade and Mannco.store started being a thing around this time. Presumably to save face after the SR tagging, Peanuthero stepped down, and "Alex" took his place. Alex did not have a history on the trading scene, nobody knew who he was, and it was speculated, but never proven, that him and Peanuthero were the same person.

Again, Alex took to attacking sites in the ScrapTF network with DDoS tools some time in late 2020.

Alex was browsing pages of backpack.tf to launch DDoS attacks on from his home IP address. Alex was logged out of the site, but backpack.tf permanently stores IP records per user account. We were able to cross-reference an IP address that was navigating to certain pages before a booter would run on that route, and an IP address recently used by Alex. This led us to investigate and connect their identities.

I promptly banned the Mannco.store staff from backpack.tf for repeatedly denying their affiliation with these attacks, and we requested SteamRep to apply Alex's SteamRep tag to his new account based on the information we uncovered. This prompted the Mannco.store staff to make [this post](https://archive.ph/hkDUL), where they, again, make the claim that they are two separate people. This is blatantly untrue, and Mannco.store are lying to their customers.

Fast forward to 2022, Alex has decided to DDoS our network *once again*, so I decided to take the time to write this up and explain why he is banned from everywhere and why you should not want anything to do with him.

We have: a Peanuthero and an Alex who both declare themselves to be Alexandre Gagnon, both from Quebec, both working on the same projects, with the same friends. Emmanuel Chevreux has worked on Sourcerev since 2015 [according to his resume](https://archive.ph/jTL33), and it is highly likely that Emmanuel had something to do with Alex's Hackforums scam projects as well. 

Alex lies as a defense mechanism. Alex will never admit his past identity, and would rather you believe that they are separate people: that Peanuthero just vanished off of the internet, that he just came out of literally nowhere with a huge interest in TF2 trading, and it was all just a freaky coincidence.

Of course, this is ridiculous.
