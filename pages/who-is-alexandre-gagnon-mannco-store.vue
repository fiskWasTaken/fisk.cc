          <strong>16th May, 2024:</strong> Hello! It's been almost two years since this article was published. I posted
          it online and just let it share.
          Since
          then, Acuata.com was taken down and Alex's projects no longer link to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most notably, <em>all</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/acuata.com" target="_blank">web.archive.org
          entries
          were scrubbed</a>. Alex went as far as to re-register peanuthero.com <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240118004209/http://peanuthero.com/" target="_blank">to scrub that as
          well</a>. I really dislike that the Wayback
          Machine actually allows this, considering they are meant to be an archive. The lack of any archival allows
          scammers such as Alex to continue operating with a tabula rasa.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thankfully, archive.is does not seem to care about frivolous takedown requests, so those are preserved.
        </p>
        <p>
          People still seem to be interested in his identity since I get emails about it. It's for the best that this information stays current, because this is someone who tries very hard to scrub
          their identity from the internet. Bitrot is also a problem and as time goes on, websites die. This removes vital context from forum posts when they embed images from dead image hosts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The article has been updated with dead links removed, and has virtually been rewritten yet again for improved
          reading. Important updates will be addressed with a box like this. Without further ado:

      <h1>Who is Alexandre Gagnon?</h1>

      <div class="section">
        <p>
          In December 2020, there was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">distributed
          denial-of-service
          attack</a> on the ScrapTF network; the collective of <em>Team Fortress 2</em> trading websites better known as
          backpack.tf, Scrap.TF, and Marketplace.TF. The attacker would navigate
          to specific pages moments before an attack would hit. Cross-referencing these requests with known user IPs
          allowed
          us to determine who was doing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This prompted further investigation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <p>
          <strong>Alexandre Gagnon</strong>, or <em>Peanuthero</em>, is an individual from Quebec, Canada. Alex has a
          paper trail of scams on the
          internet due to his activities on HackForums and other websites. If you are familiar with <em>Team Fortress
          2</em> trading,
          this is the same Alex that runs Mannco.store.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alex's modus operandi is DDoS attacks and false DMCA takedowns against competing services. Despite efforts to
          separate his identities, there are many ties between his personas. Alex will deny any claims and actively goes
          out of his
          way to remove references to his past life. This post documents these behaviours and links his different
          identities
          together.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>
          False DMCA takedowns
        </h2>
        <p>
          Alex operated <em>AsterionServeurs</em> from roughly 2008 to 2013. This was a private server platform for <em>Dofus</em>,
          a
          popular French MMORPG. Alex was hostile towards other server operators, filing false DMCA notices against at
          least
          one.
        </p>
        <h3>
          November 2013
        </h3>
        <p>
          Alex impersonates French video game developer Ankama to send fraudulent DMCA notices to competing
          private servers. Alex upsets the private server community and argues with them on <a
            href="https://archive.ph/ElqbV">a public
          forum</a>.
        </p>
        <img src="/img/articles/peanuthero-dofus-dmca.png"/>
        <p>
          It is presumed that Alex did not realise that DMCA requests are forwarded to the complainant. Alex reported
          using
          his real name. This is the first time we see Peanuthero being related to an Alexandre Gagnon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alex identified himself as the owner of AsterionServeurs on his former personal website, peanuthero.com.
        </p>
        <div class="alert alert-update">
          Since this article was published, peanuthero.com was scrubbed from the Wayback Machine. Alex did not, however,
          take down the AsterionServeurs Facebook page where he <a href="https://archive.md/UjCUw" target="_blank">mentions
          his peanuthero Skype handle</a>.
        </div>
      </div>

        <h2>A series of web hosting scams</h2>

        <div class="alert alert-update">
          HackForums requires a user login, and the linked threads are only locally-saved snippets. I advise you create
          a HackForums account if you wish to fully corroborate these details!
        </div>

        <p>
          In 2016, Alex scammed uncountable amounts of money from HackForums users. Alex would claim his services were
          "offshore" and "takedown-free". In other words, his services would ignore takedown requests for unlawful
          content.
        </p>

        <h3>July 2016: Peanuthero and OutlawServers.ca</h3>
        <div class="alert alert-update">
          <p>
            Previously, this article linked to a single page on a thread that was confusing without context. This time,
            I've archived a print copy of every page for easy reading:
          </p>
          <ul class="page-links">
            <li v-for="i in 7">
              <a :href="`/archive/scammed-by-peanuthero/${i}/Scammed by Peanuthero_ UID=2767097 for $3,377.78 - Printable Version.html`">Page
                {{ i }}</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Again, you can create an account on HackForums to read this thread without relying on my cache.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          As Peanuthero, Alex advertises OutlawServers.ca, a "black hat" web hosting
          service. Alex would use aliases such as "Robert Deschemin" in support tickets with his customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.spamhaus.org/">Spamhaus</a>, a widely-used anti-spam blacklist, soon blacklists Alex's
          service.
        </p>

        <img src="/img/articles/fake-tickets.png"/>

        <p>
          Covering
          this up, Alex <a
            href="/archive/scammed-by-peanuthero/1/Scammed%20by%20Peanuthero_%20UID=2767097%20for%20$3,377.78%20-%20Printable%20Version.html">revokes
          $4,000 worth of services from a single
          user</a>, claiming it was because
          the user was hosting child pornography. The user in question discovers that <a
            href="/archive/scammed-by-peanuthero/6/Scammed%20by%20Peanuthero_%20UID=2767097%20for%20$3,377.78%20-%20Printable%20Version.html">Alex
          was fabricating support tickets from
          the upstream</a> to back up his lie.
        </p>

        <h3>August 2016: SkylerRaine and BPServers</h3>

        <p>
          As "SkylerRaine", Alex is caught <a href="/archive/bpservers-scam-alert.html">reselling
          hosting from the
          Netherlands</a> at 200% markup via BPServers, his new bullet-proof service. Alex
          would assert his claims in private messages, to customers who knew how routing on the internet worked.
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
          <div class="quote__text">
            "I attempted to explain all of this to SkylerRaine, but was met with a bunch of read PM’s, but no replies. The last thing he said to me was this:"

        </div>

        <img src="/archive/Community%20Alert%20BPServers,%20a%20_Bullet%20Proof%20Host_,%20Just%20Reselling%20from%20Ecatel%20-%20Also%20Ran%20by%20Peanuthero%20-%20Printable%20Version_files/ImRQ9pt.png"/>

        <div class="quote">
          <div class="quote__text">"He doesn’t understand, or maybe he does, that just because the company who owns the IP is based out of Seychelles, and the whois on the IP says Seychelles, does not mean that the IP is pointing at a server out of Seychelles."</div>

        </div>

        <p>
          In other words, it is very easy to find out where the server resolving to an IP address roughly is.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seasoned users suspected this was Alex based on his writing style, and further sleuthing leads to his next ban.
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
          <div class="quote__text">
            So I’ll make this part quick because I don’t really remember who Peanuthero is, but apparently he scammed a few thousand dollars from users here and got himself perm banned. It has become pretty clear that SkylerRaine is here to proxy sell for Peanuthero. Here is an image of Skype showing Peanuthero advertising BPServers.ru:

        <h3>September 2016: manandco and ShadowHosting</h3>

        <p>
          As "manandco" (mannco?), Alex returns yet again to advertise ShadowHosting
          &ndash; yet another
          offshore service. Again, another host claiming to operate out of the Seychelles, <a
            href="/archive/shadowhosting.html">traced to the
          Netherlands</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet again, HackForums users identify this new user to be another sock of Alex's. A CloudFlare employee helps tie this with Alex's other projects, including layer7.pw (also previously featured on Acuata.com).
        </p>
        <img src="/archive/Community%20Alert%20Shadowhosting.net%20-%20Fake%20Bullet%20Proof%20Hosting%20-%20Ban%20Evasion%20-%20Proxy%20Selling%20-%20Printable%20Version_files/3kLdjRQ.png" />
        <p>
          After finally leaving the forum, Alex would continue hosting payment portals for BPServers.ru <a
            href="https://archive.md/HQa4P">through to
          2017</a>, although the abandoned client area was no longer usable.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Acuata.com</h2>

        <div class="alert alert-update">
          Since this article's creation, Acuata.com has been removed from the Wayback Machine. Additionally, as of
          writing, Acuata.com is just a placeholder page. We have a <a href="https://archive.is/sgFo4">snapshot from
          2020</a>!
        </div>

        <p>
          Alex's HackForums scams would link to Acuata.com in the footer. Likewise, Acuata.com would link back to these
          services. Acuata is "a private
          contractor that work on multiples (sic) communities & websites".
        </p>

        <img src="/img/articles/acuata.com-now.png"/>

        <p>Although the site is way older, Acuata has listed "Alexandre Gagnon" as the Director/Founder since at least
          2018. This is corroborated by Alex's company listings.</p>

        <p>Also on the roster is:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Emmanuel Chevreux, a long-time friend of Alex from his Dofus days, who has worked alongside him since <a
              href="https://archive.ph/jTL33">at least
            2015</a> on a project known as Sourcerev.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://lagg.me/" target="_blank">Anthony Garcia</a>, a.k.a. "Lagg", Team Fortress 2 Wiki sysop.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hadrien Jared, of <a href="https://archive.md/QSBej">Hadrien Design</a>. Hadrien has designed the web
            frontend on a lot
            of Alex's projects, from Acuata.com, to SourceRev, to Mannco.store.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Acuata.com first appeared on January 15, 2014, having a very different set of services on its roster:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            layer7.pw, a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) / "booter" service.
          </li>
          <li>
            OutlawServers.ca, a "bullet proof" hosting service. "Bullet proof" is slang for "will ignore any legal
            letters".
          </li>
          <li>
            BPServers.ru, an offshore hosting service "for your personal botnet".
          </li>
        </ul>

        <img src="/img/articles/acuata.com-2016.png"/>

        <p>
          These services no longer exist, and the frontpage of Acuata.com no longer reference these.
        </p>

        <p>
          Acuata.com has never changed ownership according to WHOIS records, indicating that it has always been owned by
          one person.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Mannco.store and an identity crisis</h2>

        <p>
          Peanuthero's first appearance in the Steam trading space was with <em>mannco.jackpot</em>. This was a gambling
          website
          which would use backpack.tf web APIs to fetch price data. At that time, a policy was in place to disallow use
          of
          this data by gambling websites. After revoked API access and repeated attempts to circumvent a block, Alex
          took
          to
          launching DDoS attacks on backpack.tf.
        </p>

        <p>
          Peanuthero would receive a SteamRep tag when it was discovered one of his bots, for some reason, had an
          unexplained
          SteamRep Scammer tag. <a
            href="https://forums.steamrep.com/threads/appeal-76561198026734540-%E2%9C%85peanuthero-mannco-trade-banned-by-sr.180729/">Peanuthero's
          appeal against the
          tag</a>
          was declined.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mannco.trade and Mannco.store launched around this time. This is when <em>Peanuthero</em> stepped down, and
          "Alex" took his place. Nobody knew who Alex was, and Alex had no history in the trading scene. While it was suspected that they
          were the same person, there was no concrete evidence at that moment, allowing him to operate this way for roughly a year.
        </p>

        <p>
          Certain Mannco.store staff have helped Alex with his scams. The footer of HackForums-era BPServers.ru
          references
          web
          designer brand <em>wbxdsg</em>, a project of <a href="https://archive.ph/B1CbV">Nicolas Durand</a>. This name
          appears in
          the
          footer of
          an old Mannco.trade page template which is <a href="https://archive.ph/mXnG8">still online today</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Attacks on the ScrapTF network</h3>

        <p>
          Following a major feature release on Mannco.store in December of 2020, sites in the ScrapTF network
          were being hit with DDoS attacks.
        </p>

        <p>
          A certain IP address would browse to specific pages right before an application-level attack would hit that
          page
          &ndash; a technique to work out which pages would load the slowest, thus the more vulnerable to an attack.
          Cross-referencing IPs with our database led us to Alex, and most of the information found in this article was first discovered.
        </p>

        <p>
          With the identities linked, the main Mannco.store staff received bans from the website, and SteamRep
          reinstated a
          tag on Alex's new Steam account upon our request. Following this incident, Mannco.store published <a
            href="https://archive.ph/hkDUL" target="_blank">an
          article</a> claiming that Alex and Peanuthero are two different people.
        </p>

        <h3>Minelauva Holdings Limited and TF2Shop</h3>

        <div class="alert alert-update">
          This is a new section. The scrubbing of Acuata.com removed evidence of Anthony Garcia's involvement, but this ties it back in nicely.
        </div>

        <p>
          There is a curious company in the footer of several of Alex's websites. It is Minelauva Holdings Limited, a company registered in Cyprus.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anthony Garcia is referenced earlier in this article, as a listed employee of Acuata. Anthony Garcia lists himself as a <a href="https://archive.is/BdBsg">developer of TF2Shop</a> and several sister sites. The site has changed a lot over the years.
        </p>

        <p>
          TF2Shop, Mannco.store and Mannco.trade have Minelauva Holdings Limited in their footers and terms of services, and TF2Shop appears to now use the <a href="https://archive.is/deocj">exact same page template</a>. We can reasonably deduce that TF2Shop is now owned by Alex.
        </p>

        <p>
          An archive of <a href="https://archive.ph/BVLVv">status.minelauvaholdings.com</a> shows us it only had anything to do with Alex's websites. It is just a status page showing graphs for Mannco.store services et al.
        </p>

        <p>
          But what exactly <em>is</em> Minelauva Holdings Limited? It's not registered to Alexandre Gagnon, but these people:

          VARRINGTON INTERNATIONAL LLC is not a entity that exists anywhere. Presumably, the other names listed have nothing to do with anything. I don't speak Greek. If you can solve this mystery, let me know.

          Registered in the UK under Alexandre Gagnon and dissolved as of 2021. For some reason, Alex put his
          nationality as
          'British' in the original filing before changing it to Canadian.

          <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Yrow76/videos">Alex's old Youtube channel</a>. One of Alex's older aliases is <a href="https://archive.is/84OwV" target="_blank">yrow76</a>. It's just Dofus and Minecraft videos.</li>
          <li>Amusingly, a Peanuthero is still active on a forum for carding scams, <em><a href="https://archive.is/zP6mg">today!!</a></em>
            He doesn't post anymore, so I'm not sure what he is doing. These posts are from 2013 and there's nothing to corroborate it with another identity.</li>
          <li><a href="https://archive.is/70n28">spyroow</a> is another old Skype alias. Peanuthero also used to go by "Spyrow" on reality-gaming.fr.</li>
          <li>Again, peanuthero shows up in <a href="https://archive.is/syTcE">a cache for another closed carding site</a>.</li>
