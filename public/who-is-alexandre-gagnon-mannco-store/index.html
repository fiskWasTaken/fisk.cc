                <p>Alexandre Gagnon is a con artist from Quebec, Canada. Alex has a paper trail of scams on the internet due to his activities on HackForums and other websites.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with Team Fortress 2 trading, this is the same Alex that runs Mannco.store. The staff on the project are friends who helped Alex perform scams on his previous aliases. Alex&rsquo;s modus operandi is to run DDoS attacks on competitor websites. The site is blacklisted from PayPal for a very good reason.</p>
<p>Alex has attempted to reinvent his identity to remove ties to his past scams. Previously known as Peanuthero, Alex has scammed many people out of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Despite best efforts to separate his identities, there are many obvious ties between the two personas. This has to be emphasised because Alex will always deny these claims. Alex&rsquo;s friends have gone as far as write entire blog posts fabricating a tale to salvage his reputation.</p>
<h2 id="alexs-many-many-hackforums-scams">Alex&rsquo;s many, many HackForums scams</h2>
<p><strong>NB</strong>: The threads linked here are local archives because HackForums requires a user login. You can verify the contents yourself by signing in to HackForums, as the threads are likely to stay.</p>
<p><img src="/img/articles/skype.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In 2016, Alex took to HackForums to sell web hosting services. Posting as Peanuthero, Alex would claim his services were &ldquo;offshore&rdquo; and &ldquo;takedown-free&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Users would purchase Alex&rsquo;s services under the impression that his claims were legitimate. However, users soon discovered Alex was merely <a href="/archive/bpservers-scam-alert.html">reselling hosting from the Netherlands</a> at 200% markup.</p>
<p>Alex&rsquo;s services were also eventually blacklisted by <a href="https://www.spamhaus.org/">Spamhaus</a>, a widely-used anti-spam blacklist. Covering this up, <a href="/archive/scammed-by-peanuthero.html">Alex infamously scammed a user out of over US$4,000</a>, falsely claiming it was because the user was hosting child pornography. The user in question discovered that <a href="/archive/peanuthero-support-tickets.html">Alex was fabricating support tickets from the upstream</a> to prove his claim.</p>
<p>Another reputable user investigated Alex&rsquo;s cryptocurrency wallet transfers and identified that he was <a href="/archive/peanuthero-ban-evasion.html">still using wallet addresses known to be used in scams</a>.</p>
<p>Peanuthero was eventually banned from the forum in July 2016. Alex would return and <a href="/archive/bpservers-ru-sock.html">sign up to HackForums with sock accounts</a> to continue advertising his own services. Seasoned users identified him almost immediately, and his sock accounts were banned from the forums. Alex would then immediately cut access for the users who paid for his service.</p>
<p>Alex returned a second time as &lsquo;manandco&rsquo; (mannco?) to advertise yet another offshore service. Just like prior projects, this was another snake oil host claiming to operate out of the Seychelles, but again <a href="/archive/shadowhosting.html">traced to the Netherlands</a>.</p>
<p>After finally leaving the forum, Alex would continue hosting payment portals for BPServers.ru <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710174638/https://bpservers.ru/">through to 2017</a>, even though the client area was abandoned and could no longer be used.</p>
<p>The footer of BPServers references web designer brand &lsquo;wbxdsg&rsquo;, a project of <a href="https://archive.ph/B1CbV">Nicolas Durand</a>. This name appears in the footer of an old Mannco.trade page template which is <a href="https://archive.ph/mXnG8">still online today</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/articles/wbxdsg-bpservers.png" alt="">
<img src="/img/articles/wbxdsg.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="acuatacom">Acuata.com</h2>
<p>Alex&rsquo;s HackForums scams would directly link to Acuata.com in the footer, and likewise, Acuata.com was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423042823/http://acuata.com/">linking back</a> to these services. Acuata is &ldquo;a private contractor that work on multiples (sic) communities &amp; websites&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="/img/articles/acuata.com-now.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Although the site is way older, Acuata has clearly listed &ldquo;Alexandre Gagnon&rdquo; as the Director/Founder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180412212144/https://acuata.com/">since at least 2018</a>. This overlaps the time in which Alex changed his identities.</p>
<p>Also on the roster is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emmanuel Chevreux, a long-time friend of Alex from his Dofus days, who has worked alongside him since <a href="https://archive.ph/jTL33">at least 2015</a> on a project known as Sourcerev.</li>
<li>Anthony Garcia, a.k.a. &ldquo;Lagg&rdquo;, a Team Fortress 2 Wiki sysop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Acuata.com was registered on January 15, 2014, previously having a very different set of services on its roster:</p>
<ul>
<li>layer7.pw, a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) / &ldquo;booter&rdquo; service.</li>
<li>OutlawServers.ca, a &ldquo;bullet proof&rdquo; hosting service.</li>
<li>BPServers.ru, an offshore hosting service &ldquo;for your personal botnet&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/articles/acuata.com-2016.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These services no longer exist, and the frontpage of Acuata.com no longer references these. Snapshots are still available on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220000000000*/acuata.com">web.archive.org</a>.</p>
<p>For some reason, Mannco.store and Mannco.trade are not shown on the current iteration as of writing, <a href="https://archive.ph/KHmlf">despite being on the portfolio in 2020</a>, despite all related site staff being listed there.</p>
<p>Acuata.com has never changed ownership according to WHOIS records.</p>
<h2 id="dofus-and-false-dmca-takedowns">Dofus, and false DMCA takedowns</h2>
<p>Dofus is an MMORPG popular among French-speaking communities. Dofus has private servers operated by individuals.  Alex operated his own community, AsterionServeurs, from roughly 2008 to 2012. Alex was using Peanuthero as a username at this time.</p>
<p>Alex had a hostile attitude towards other server operators, and filed false DMCA takedowns for at least one. <a href="https://archive.ph/ElqbV">A thread (in French)</a> documents Alex&rsquo;s attempts to send fraudulent DMCA takedown notices by impersonating the game&rsquo;s developer.</p>
<p><img src="/img/articles/peanuthero-dofus-dmca.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As Peanuthero, Alex would send false DMCAs to Cloudflare as &ldquo;Alexandre Gagnon&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We know this is the same Peanuthero that eventually goes on to scam HackForums users, as he identified himself as owners of such services on his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141218054701/http://peanuthero.com/">former website</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/articles/peanuthero.com.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="steamrep-tagging-ban-evasion-and-attacks-on-the-scraptf-network">SteamRep tagging, ban evasion and attacks on the ScrapTF network</h2>
<p>Peanuthero initially appeared in the Steam trading space by hosting a gambling site, mannco.jackpot. Alex took to DDoSing backpack.tf as early as 2017, shortly after we revoked his access to our web APIs, which we did as we were working to deter use of the service for gambling sites.</p>
<p>Peanuthero received a SteamRep tag after it was revealed one his bots, for some reason, had an unexplained SteamRep Scammer tag. <a href="https://forums.steamrep.com/threads/appeal-76561198026734540-%E2%9C%85peanuthero-mannco-trade-banned-by-sr.180729/">Peanuthero appealed against the tag</a>, but this was subsequently declined.</p>
<p>Mannco.trade and Mannco.store launched around this time. This is when Peanuthero stepped down, and a new &ldquo;Alex&rdquo; took his place. Nobody knew who Alex was, and it was speculated, but never proven, that him and Peanuthero were the same person.</p>
<p>Again, Alex took to attacking sites in the ScrapTF network with DDoS tools some time in late 2020. Alex was caught through cross-referencing the last-known IP addresses of his user accounts, and the IP of an anonymous user that was navigating to pages minutes before a booter would run.</p>
<p>I promptly banned the Mannco.store staff from backpack.tf for repeatedly denying their affiliation with these attacks, and we requested SteamRep to apply Alex&rsquo;s SteamRep tag to his new account based on the information we uncovered. This prompted the Mannco.store staff to make <a href="https://archive.ph/hkDUL">this post</a>, where they, again, make the claim that they are two separate people. This is blatantly untrue, and Mannco.store are lying to their customers.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2022, Alex has decided to DDoS our network on two separate occasions this year.
This has prompted me to finally write this up, and this will be linked from any relevant banned user pages.</p>
