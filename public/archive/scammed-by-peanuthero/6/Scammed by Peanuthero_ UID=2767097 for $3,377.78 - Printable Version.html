So apparently, PeanutLiar, said to several members that I was indeed hosting CP. He, supplied them with a screenshot from stephost (where he buys the server) saying that the server was terminated due to CP:<br>

<br>
Well, I contacted Stephost myself, and gave them a copy on that "ticket" peanutfucker showed, as stephost assured me it was taken down because of a SPAMHAUS report.<br>

<br>
As it turns out PEANUTLIAR, fabricated that evidence HIMSELF, and lied to all the members who he shown that FALSE evidence. Here is Stephost's reply to my query if they indeed told me something wrong:<br>

<br>
READ "PETRU's" response: "I can't write two tickets at the same second". Which means the evidence by peanut fucker, liar and scammer, WAS FABRICATED BY HIM!
