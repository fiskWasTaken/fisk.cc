Sorry about your loss but no idea why you would pay so much for servers which don't have much reputation/feedback?

<br>
No, I'm not surprised at all. I could hit you up with the host that he uses and I could show you the terrible markups he makes to profit without doing much. He's enjoying your money right now and it's all because I was shunned for trying to do something about it. <br>
<br>
Maybe users will listen next time.</blockquote><br>
Now hes accusing me of child porn... FUCKER!!, he closed my account after I opened the dispute and said he reported me to omni... Meanwhile, other customers are complaining about their dedicated servers being down as well... Pfff

This is terrible OP. Seems like a legit scam report although it's a delicate area because he's accusing you of hosting something illegal like that, if he can't provide proof I think he should be banned.

Legit scam report.<br>
<br>
Even i have 3 vps from Peanuthero_ and they have been down since almost 2 weeks.<br>
<br>
I get no response from him, his skype or tickets.<br>
<br>
I had to post on his HF thread to get a response out of him.<br>

Though i never got a reply.<br>
<br>
I'm always reluctant on opening a scam/deal dispute, but i'll open one against Outlawservers and him if it gets too much out of hand.

Of course hes lying! He doesn't have proof... all the dedicated servers went down, so as the VPS went down a couple weeks ago... and he had no other choice to accuse me of something to TRY to look good. I'll fucking crush him...<br>

Even so, I was hosting a botnet... lots of people here could verify that as I was buying crypters, loads, etc.<br>

I suggest you give him neutral reputation &amp; link this dispute so others who check his rep before dealing see he's a scammer. Also I suggest charging back / reaching out to bank if possible.
